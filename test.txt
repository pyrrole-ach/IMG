As the human cost of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being witnessed worldwide, the
development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents against emerging and
re-emerging viruses is seen as a necessity to hamper the spread of infections.
Various targets during the viral life-cycle can be considered to inhibit viral
infection, from viral attachment to viral fusion or replication. Macromolecules
represent a particularly attractive class of therapeutics due to their
multivalency and versatility. Although several antiviral macromolecules hold
great promise in clinical applications, the emergence of resistance after
prolonged exposure urges the need for improved solutions. In the present
article, the recent advancement in the discovery of antiviral peptides and
polymers with diverse structural features and antiviral mechanisms is
reviewed. Future perspectives, such as, the development of virucidal
peptides/polymers and their coatings against SARS-CoV-2 infection,
standardization of antiviral testing protocols, and use of artificial intelligence
or machine learning as a tool to accelerate the discovery of antiviral
macromolecules, are discussed
